# üõ∞ Phase 6: Threat Hunting

## ‚úÖ Objectives

1. Build and automate a **Live Threat Intelligence Feed** from AlienVault OTX into Microsoft Sentinel.

2. Apply the **SQR3 Hypothesis Framework** (State, Question, Refine, Review, Report) to hunt the `JOKER` account.

3. Run multiple **KQL hunting queries** for logons, processes, file activity, and registry changes.

4. Create a **chronological timeline** of attacker actions.

5. Perform **correlation analysis** between events.

6. Compile a comprehensive **IOC table** with all commands, IPs, registry keys, and scheduled tasks.

7. Deploy a **Global Threat Map** using honeypot data.

8. Execute **final containment and remediation actions**.

## üõ∞ 1. Live Threat Intelligence Feed (OTX Integration)

**Objective**  
Automate ingestion of **subscribed AlienVault OTX pulse indicators** into Microsoft Sentinel to enhance threat hunting with up-to-date IOCs.

**Implementation**
- Logic App calls OTX `/pulses/subscribed`.
- Filters **IPv4**, **domain**, **URL**, **hostname**, and **hash** indicators.
- Tags each IOC with `"OTX"` and the **pulse name**.
- Deduplicates before ingestion into `ThreatIntelligenceIndicator`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üß† Notes & Design Choices</strong></summary>

- Favor REST API for full control over filtering, tagging, and deduplication.  
- Post to `ThreatIntelligenceIndicator` with standardized `Tags: ["OTX", "<PulseName>"]`.  
- Add a **source reliability** tag (e.g., `Confidence=Medium`) for downstream analytics.
- Using a Logic App to pull in external IOCs allows for full automation and control over which pulses we want to bring in.

## üîç 2. SQR3 Hypothesis Framework

**Hypothesis**  
If the `JOKER` account is active, it may engage in **privilege abuse**, **defense evasion**, **persistence**, **credential access**, or **data exfiltration**.

**Scope (last 7 days)**  
Hunt in: `DeviceLogonEvents`, `DeviceProcessEvents`, `DeviceFileEvents`, `DeviceRegistryEvents`.

**Key Questions**
1. Unexpected logons or lateral movement?  
2. Suspicious binaries/scripts executed (LoLBins, credential tools)?  
3. System/registry configuration changes?  
4. Sensitive file access or new administrative accounts?

**Refine**  
If hits appear (e.g., LSASS dump tools, `net user`), **pivot** into device timeline and correlate with firewall/process activity.

**Results**  
Summarize Joker‚Äôs actions **chronologically**, map to **MITRE ATT&CK**, and propose **detections**.

1. **External IP logon** ‚Üí `T1078` (Valid Accounts)  
2. **Create Scheduled Task** `JokerHeartbeat` ‚Üí `T1053`  
3. **Delete Outlook Add-in DLL** via `cmd.exe` ‚Üí `T1070` (Indicator Removal on Host)  
4. **Create BackdoorSvc** ‚Üí `T1543` (Create/Modify System Process)  
5. **Add firewall allow rule** for `notepad.exe` ‚Üí `T1562` (Impair Defenses)  
6. **Execute calc.exe** via `mshta.exe` & `regsvr32.exe` ‚Üí `T1218` (Signed Binary Proxy Execution)  
7. **Create Scheduled Task** `JokerTask` ‚Üí `T1053`

## üîó 5. Correlation Analysis

- **Logons ‚Üí Processes:** Linked Joker‚Äôs remote logons to subsequent **scheduled task creation** and **service creation**.  
- **Process ‚Üí Firewall:** Correlated `sc.exe`/`schtasks.exe` activity with `netsh.exe` changes (defense evasion).  
- **Gaps:** No corroborated **file staging** or **registry** persistence in this period.  
- **Assessment:** Activity indicates **persistence attempts** and **defense evasion** rather than data theft.

<details>
<summary><strong>üß© Analyst Notes</strong></summary>

- The combination of scheduled tasks and service creation is a classic persistence chain.  
- The use of `mshta` and `regsvr32` suggests living-off-the-land execution to evade detection.  
- Lack of file/registry artifacts could indicate **trial-and-error** staging or **cleanup**.

## üåç 7. Global Threat Map (Honeypot Integration)

**Objective**  
Visualize **live malicious activity** targeting our honeypot to correlate external attacker IPs with exploitation patterns and enrich hunts with **geo context**.

**Implementation Steps**
1. **Honeypot Deployment & Capture** ‚Äì Collect unsolicited inbound connection attempts.  
2. **Export Attacker IPs** ‚Äì CSV of observed IPs.  
3. **Sentinel Watchlist** ‚Äì Create `HoneypotIPs` and upload **55k+ IPs**.  
4. **Workbook Query** ‚Äì Geolocate and plot IPs for a **real-time attack map**.

**Sample KQL (Workbook)**
```kql
let HoneypotIPs = (_GetWatchlist('HoneypotIPs') | project SearchKey);
Heartbeat
| where RemoteIP in (HoneypotIPs)
| extend GeoInfo = geo_info_from_ip_address(RemoteIP)
| summarize AttemptCount = count() by tostring(GeoInfo.Country), tostring(GeoInfo.City), bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| project TimeGenerated, Country=GeoInfo.Country, City=GeoInfo.City, AttemptCount
```

<details>
<summary><strong>üõ†Ô∏è Notes</strong></summary>

- Ensure watchlist column used in `project SearchKey` matches your CSV header.  
- If your telemetry table differs from `Heartbeat`, adjust the `where` clause to the table that contains `RemoteIP`.
</details>

---

## üõ° 8. Final Containment & Remediation Actions

- **Disable** `JOKER` account in **Active Directory**.  
- **Revoke** all active sessions and tokens.  
- **Force** 20-character complex password reset.  
- **Isolate** affected endpoints for **forensics**.  
- **Create** Sentinel detection rule for any `"joker"` account activity.

<details>
<summary><strong>üí° Detection Suggestion (KQL stub)</strong></summary>

```kql
union isfuzzy=true
    DeviceLogonEvents,
    DeviceProcessEvents,
    DeviceRegistryEvents,
    DeviceFileEvents
| where AccountName =~ "joker" or InitiatingProcessAccountName =~ "joker"
| summarize Count = count(), FirstSeen=min(TimeGenerated), LastSeen=max(TimeGenerated) by AccountName, DeviceName
| where Count > 0
```
Use as an **analytics rule** (scheduled) with appropriate entity mapping and suppression logic.
</details>

---

### ‚úÖ Outcome
- Confirmed **persistence & defense evasion** attempts by `JOKER`.  
- No confirmed **file staging** or **registry** persistence within the window.  
- Hardened account controls and established **detections** for rapid response.
