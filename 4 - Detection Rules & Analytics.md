# üîç Phase 4 - Detection Rules & Analytics&#x20;

This phase focuses on building detection analytics to identify attacker behaviors simulated in Phase 2. Custom analytic rules were created in Microsoft Sentinel to detect specific techniques across the Cyber Kill Chain. Each rule was validated by generating logs in the client VM, verifying alerts and incidents, and documenting the results.

## üìú Detection Queries and Incidents

Each rule below includes the KQL query, a short narrative of how the rule was built, the scan interval used in Sentinel, and associated screenshots:

### 1. **Malicious .docm Execution Detection**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName contains "WINWORD.EXE"
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFolderPath, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ProcessIntegrityLevel, IsInitiatingProcessRemoteSession
```

- I created a query rule inside Sentinel‚Äôs analytics to look for suspicious PowerShell processes spawned from macro-embedded Word documents. This simulated a phishing attack using `.docm` files with embedded scripts.
- **Scan interval:** Every 5 minutes, looking back 1 hour.

### 2. **Reverse Shell Detection**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_all ("-nop", "NoProfile", "Hidden", "EncodedCommand")
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("Invoke-Expression", "IEX")
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ProcessIntegrityLevel
```

- I built this rule to detect obfuscated reverse shell PowerShell commands, often launched with encoded and hidden execution flags from macro payloads or remote execution.
- **Scan interval:** Every 5 minutes, looking back 1 hour.

### 3. **LSASS Access**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName =~ ("procdump.exe", "mimikatz.exe")
  or ProcessCommandLine has_any ("lsass.exe", "comsvcs.dll", "-ma", "dum", "sekurlsa")
| where ProcessCommandLine has "lsass"
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ProcessIntegrityLevel
```

- This rule detects common tools and behaviors used to access or dump LSASS memory, a technique attackers use to steal credentials after gaining access (LOLBins).
- **Scan interval:** Every 5 minutes, looking back 1 hour.

### 4. **Suspicious Scheduled Tasks (User Associated)**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName =~ "schtasks.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine has "/create"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName !startswith "NT AUTHORITY"
    and InitiatingProcessAccountName !startswith "SYSTEM"
    and InitiatingProcessAccountName !startswith "localService"
    and InitiatingProcessAccountName !startswith "NetworkService"
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

- I designed this rule to find suspicious scheduled tasks being created from user accounts, which could indicate attacker persistence via startup scripts or unauthorized jobs.
- **Scan interval:** Every 5 minutes, looking back 1 hour.

### 5. **User Creation + Immediate Privilege Escalation**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("net user", "net1 user", "/add", "net localgroup administrators")
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, DeviceName
```

- I configured this rule to detect when a new local user is created and then quickly added to the Administrators group‚Äîan indicator of privilege escalation.
- **Scan interval:** Every 5 minutes, looking back 1 hour.

### 6. **Data Exfiltration via NGROK**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemoteUrl contains "ngrok"
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```

- This detection monitors outbound network connections to ngrok.io, a tunneling tool used by attackers to bypass firewalls and exfiltrate data.
- **Scan interval:** Every 5 minutes, looking back 14 days.

## üìä MITRE ATT&CK Coverage

All detection rules were mapped to ATT&CK TTPs and visualized in Microsoft Sentinel‚Äôs **MITRE ATT&CK Preview** blade.

üì∏ *These are the MITRE TTPs we have covered with our analytic rules*

**Mapped Coverage Includes:**

- Initial Access ‚Üí T1566.001: Phishing (Attachment)
- Execution ‚Üí T1059.001: Command and Scripting Interpreter (PowerShell)
- Persistence ‚Üí T1053.005: Scheduled Task/Job, T1136.001: Create Account
- Privilege Escalation ‚Üí T1136.001: Create Account
- Credential Access ‚Üí T1003.001: OS Credential Dumping
- Discovery ‚Üí T1069.001: Permission Groups Discovery
- C2 ‚Üí T1071.001: Application Layer Protocol
- Exfiltration ‚Üí T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

## ‚úÖ Status

Phase 4 is complete. All detections successfully generated alerts and incidents, and each query was tested against real attacker telemetry simulated in Phase 2.

Next step: Begin Phase 5 (Incident Response Playbooks).
