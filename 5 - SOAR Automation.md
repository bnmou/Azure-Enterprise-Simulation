# ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 5: SOAR Automation

**Azure SOC Operations Home Lab | Analyst-Triggered Playbooks**

In **Phase 5** of my Azure SOC simulation, I developed four deeply integrated Microsoft Sentinel playbooks for real-world SOAR automation. These **analyst-triggered playbooks** automate detection and containment of:

* Malicious macro payload execution
* Reverse shell activity
* Suspicious user privilege escalation
* LSASS credential dumping attempts

Each Logic App was carefully constructed with exact permissions, robust API authentication, user filtering, and multi-platform alerting.

## üîπ Playbook: MacroExecution AutoResponse Playbook

<details>
<summary><strong>üîç Malicious Macro Auto-Response</strong></summary>

### üîê Purpose

Triggers when a `.docm` file containing a malicious macro is executed, initiating a containment workflow to tag the device, block further app execution, and notify analysts and users.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Logic App Breakdown

**Trigger**: Analyst-triggered Microsoft Sentinel incident (Preview)

**Required Permissions**:

* Logic App API connection to Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
* Logic App Managed Identity must have:

  * `Microsoft Sentinel Responder` role on Sentinel workspace
  * `Machine.Isolate`, `Alert.Read`, `Machine.Read.All`, and `Machine.RunAntiVirusScan` API permissions on Defender

**Step-by-Step Breakdown**:

4. **Restrict App Execution**

   * Applies "Attack Surface Reduction" tagging via Defender API.
   <img width="568" height="496" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63cac163-97bf-4e0d-b744-5f354ce2bb2b" />

5. **Run AV Scan**

   * Forces a Defender Antivirus scan remotely on affected endpoint.
  <img width="571" height="501" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9894a305-1184-4b89-9803-08133d103db1" />

6. **Send Email (V2)**

   * Notifies the affected user that a suspicious macro was executed.
   <img width="566" height="562" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7cc5778-325f-4fea-8adb-fbb75a5646a3" />

7. **Discord Alert**

   * Sends alert to SOC team via webhook with incident title and user/machine context.
   <img width="562" height="763" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/520889e0-cc47-462c-bd9f-412a22c5761d" />

8. **Get File Statistics**

   * Extracts the SHA256 hash from the malicous macro file.
   <img width="564" height="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0414df55-3bc7-4766-b81e-893b0fb8be71" />

9. **Upload SHA256 to Threat Intelligence**

   * Automatically extracts file hash from the "Get File Statistics" step and uploads it to Sentinel's custom threat intelligence table.
   <img width="563" height="778" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cb5f94d-1d7a-48ad-9a48-066e2e63cd43" />

### üß† Key Takeaways (Macro Execution Scenario)

* Defender tagging is a stealthy yet effective way to stop unknown malware execution without full isolation.
* Hash uploads allow for threat sharing across the workspace and reusable TI-based rules.
* Analyst-triggered design prevents false positives from regular macros (e.g., HR templates).

## üîπ Playbook: RevShell\_AutoResponse\_Playbook

<details>
<summary><strong>üî¥ Reverse Shell Detection & Remediation</strong></summary>

3. **Discord Alert**

   * Sends enriched alert to SOC team.

4. **Email Notification**

   * Notifies the user who launched the process.

5. **Get Auth Token**
