# üõ°Ô∏è Phase 5 ‚Äì Automated Incident Response (SOAR)

**Azure SOC Operations Home Lab | Analyst-Triggered Playbooks**

In **Phase 5** of my Azure SOC simulation, I developed four deeply integrated Microsoft Sentinel playbooks for real-world SOAR automation. These **analyst-triggered playbooks** automate detection and containment of:

* Malicious macro payload execution
* Reverse shell activity
* Suspicious user privilege escalation
* LSASS credential dumping attempts

Each Logic App was carefully constructed with exact permissions, robust API authentication, user filtering, and multi-platform alerting.

## üîπ Playbook: MacroExecution\_AutoResponse\_Playbook

<details>
<summary><strong>üîç Malicious Macro Auto-Response</strong></summary>

### üîê Purpose

Triggers when a `.docm` file containing a malicious macro is executed, initiating a containment workflow to tag the device, block further app execution, and notify analysts and users.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Logic App Breakdown

**Trigger**: Analyst-triggered Microsoft Sentinel incident (Preview)

**Required Permissions**:

* Logic App API connection to Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
* Logic App Managed Identity must have:

  * `Microsoft Sentinel Responder` role on Sentinel workspace
  * `Machine.Isolate`, `Alert.Read`, `Machine.Read.All`, and `Machine.RunAntiVirusScan` API permissions on Defender

**Step-by-Step Breakdown**:

1. **Trigger**

   * Triggered manually from the Sentinel incident.

2. **Get Incident**

   * Pulls full incident metadata.

3. **Compose Entities**

   * Extracts involved usernames, file hashes, and device names.

4. **Filter Array**

   * Filters down to devices involved in macro execution.

5. **Get Auth Token (MDE)**

   * Performs secure OAuth token retrieval for API use.

6. **Restrict App Execution**

   * Applies "Attack Surface Reduction" tagging via Defender API.

7. **Run AV Scan**

   * Forces a Defender Antivirus scan remotely on affected endpoint.

8. **Send Email (V2)**

   * Notifies the affected user that a suspicious macro was executed.

9. **Discord Alert**

   * Sends alert to SOC team via webhook with incident title and user/machine context.

10. **Upload SHA256 to Threat Intelligence**

* Automatically extracts file hash and uploads it to Sentinel's custom threat intelligence table.

### üß† Key Takeaways (Macro Execution Scenario)

* Defender tagging is a stealthy yet effective way to stop unknown malware execution without full isolation.
* Hash uploads allow for threat sharing across the workspace and reusable TI-based rules.
* Analyst-triggered design prevents false positives from regular macros (e.g., HR templates).

## üîπ Playbook: RevShell\_AutoResponse\_Playbook

<details>
<summary><strong>üî¥ Reverse Shell Detection & Remediation</strong></summary>

### üîê Purpose

Detects and responds to reverse shell attempts launched using Windows LOLBins like PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, or encoded base64 payloads.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Logic App Breakdown

**Trigger**: Analyst-initiated Microsoft Sentinel incident

**Required Permissions**:

* Logic App API connection to Sentinel and Defender
* Live response script deployment permissions on Defender

**Step-by-Step Breakdown**:

1. **Get Incident**

   * Pulls full context, including entities like command line and username.

2. **Filter Shell Command Lines**

   * Parses for known reverse shell patterns (e.g., `powershell -nop -enc`, `bash -i`)

3. **Discord Alert**

   * Sends enriched alert to SOC team.

4. **Email Notification**

   * Notifies the user who launched the process.

5. **Get Auth Token**

   * Required for script deployment.

6. **Run Live Response Script** (`DisableShellUser.ps1`)

   * Disables account, sets password reset flag, and removes from local admin group.

7. **Isolate and Tag Machine**

   * Full network isolation + tag added.

8. **Upload Command Line IOC**

   * Adds base64 reverse shell payload as custom IOC to Threat Intelligence.

### üß† Key Takeaways (Reverse Shell Scenario)

* PowerShell/encoded payloads must be handled surgically to avoid nuking valid usage.
* Account disablement + password reset adds defense-in-depth alongside isolation.
* Live response scripts give granular control beyond built-in Defender actions.
